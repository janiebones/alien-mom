    <h1><sparkle>About Me</sparkle></h1>
    <hr>
    <p>My name is Janie, I'm 38 years old at the time of writing this. Who knows how old I am now. I work as a karaoke DJ in a gay bar. My job involves lots of sitting in a room waiting for people's song to end so that I can press play on the next one. I have a fair amount of time to work on hobbies while I'm at work, though it can be difficult to focus because it is really loud here all the time. Sometimes I like singing karaoke myself, I have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@alienpharmacy">youtube channel</a> where I used to make karaoke versions of songs to sing at the bar. I stopped making them in this format when we switched to a more commercial program that doesn't allow much freedom.</p>

    <p>I play the drums for fun and sometimes jam with my girlfriend or other friends. I used to (and still might in the future) make electronic music and beats on my computer. I have a <a href="https://www.soundcloud.com/alienpharmacy">soundcloud</a> where most of that is uploaded. I listen to lots of genres of music, I enjoy hearing about other people's favorite music as well, especially when it's something I don't know anything about. My biggest genre is probably indie rock from like 20 years ago, I will always have a special place for the mountain goats in my heart.</p>

    <p>I pick up and drop hobbies often, I really like to try things that appeal to me. I enjoy arts and crafts, I'll probably include some of my work on this site eventually. I have periods of extreme enthusiasm for new hobbies, often followed by periods of disinterest when I get depressed for one reason or another. I saw a video on YouTube that was talking about the indie web and people's homepages and it got me into the idea of making this site just for fun.</p>

    <p>I am not a big TV or movie watcher, but I have a few that I like from time to time. I mostly like watching with other people though. I used to enjoy lots of podcasts and it was kinda my primary source of entertainment for years, but I really got into listening to audiobooks over the last couple of years. My favorite series (and tbh the only one I've really gotten into lately) is all the Cosmere books by Brandon Sanderson. I started a few years back with The Stormlight Archive and Mistborn and have now listened to basically everything set in this universe, some multiple times. I just find it relaxing and familiar to listen to.</p>

    <p>The name Alien Pharmacy has been something I have used as a name online since maybe 2017 or late 2016. When choosing domain names I ended up with alien.mom. And that is why the site is called alien.mom. True story.</p>
