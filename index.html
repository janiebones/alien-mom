<h1>Welcome to alien.mom!</h1>
<hr>
<p>My name is Janie, I guess I am alien mom.</p>
<p>I decided to make a website to post anything I wanted. I saw a video on YouTube about it and thought it sounded really fun. If you want to know more about me there is an about me page. Most of the other pages are unfinished! Check back regularly if that's the kind of thing that you like to do.</p>
<p>This is best viewed in a browser on your computer, it will be a little difficult to navigate on mobile.</p>
